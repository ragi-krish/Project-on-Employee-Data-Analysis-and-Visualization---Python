# **Employee Dataset Analysis**
This project involves analyzing an employee dataset to gain insights into the distribution of employees, salary expenditure, age groups, and correlations. The project focuses on handling data inconsistencies, performing descriptive analysis, and creating visualizations for effective communication of findings.

## **Features of the Project**
### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Replaced inconsistent values in the Height column with random integers between 150 and 180.
- Handled missing values:
  - Filled null values in Height and Weight columns with their mean.
  - Replaced missing values in the College column with "Unknown."
  - Filled missing values in the Salary column with the median salary.
  - Replaced null positions with "Unknown."

### **2. Analysis Tasks**
#### *Task 1: Team Distribution and Percentage*
- Calculated the number of employees in each team.
- Determined the percentage of employees relative to the total number of employees.
- Visualized the data using a bar chart.
#### *Task 2: Employee Segregation by Position*
- Segregated employees based on their positions.
- Represented the data using a pie chart.
#### *Task 3: Predominant Age Group*
- Created age groups (e.g., 15-20, 21-25, etc.).
- Counted employees in each age group.
- Visualized the data using a histogram.
#### *Task 4: Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure*
- Grouped data by Team and Position.
- Calculated the total salary expenditure for each group.
- Identified the team and position with the highest salary.
- Visualized the top expenditures using a bar chart.
#### *Task 5: Correlation Between Age and Salary*
- Calculated the correlation coefficient between age and salary.
- Represented the correlation visually using a scatter plot.
-----
### **3. Visualizations**
- Bar charts for team distribution and salary expenditure.
- Pie chart for position distribution.
- Histogram for age group distribution.
- Scatter plot for age-salary correlation.
-----
## **Insights from the Analysis**
- Teams with the highest number of employees.
- Predominant positions within the company.
- Common age groups among employees.
- Teams and positions contributing most to salary expenditure.
- Relationship between age and salary.
